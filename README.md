# Tennis app

The aim of this application is to replicate a game of tennis that can be played from the command line. I was inspired to create this app after seeing a youtube video for a [tennis kata](https://learn.madetech.com/katas/tennis/) but I would like to go beyond the basic scoring system and add more advanced functionality.

With the first 3 user stories, I can implement the basic functionality of a game of tennis and arrive at a minimum viable product.
